# numerical_methods

note:
  - The language used for these codes are that of Mathematica. The files uploaded are pdf files of the codes and results.
  - A lower level description of the code is provided in the same files that the codes are in.
  - The different numerical methods named below are coded and tested in the files they are in.
  - Algorithms are compared to each other using tables and visuals.

1. This was a little exercise to get familiar with the mathematica language. This code produces the number of steps required to get to 1 through the collatz sequence rules.
2. Bisection method
3. Regula Falsi method
4. Newton's method
5. Secant method
6. Fixed Point Iteration
7. Euler's Method & Backward Euler's
8. Improved Euler's Method
9. Runge-Kutta Method
10. Adams-Moulton & Backward Differentiation
